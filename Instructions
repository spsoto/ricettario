- Follow getting started
- Remove example, posts and comments.
- Create GraphQL for the Schemas. Some things need to be pointed out:
  * Explain why the use of extend.
  * Casing used.
  * CRUD convention
  * Use of enum
  * Use Payload for payloads
  * Explain what ID! does.
  * Notice the difference between create and update.
  * Mention docstrings. Compare them to #. Encourage the use of docstrings.
    Show that they can be used everywhere.
  * Explain why returning `null` on non existing resources instead of raising an
    error.

- Run codegen.
  * Point out that there's nothing voodoo happening here.
  * This is for bootstrapping the component.
  * Later on, when updating the schema, you're supposed to only update the types.
    TypeScript will help you introducing the required refactorings.

Features that might be missed:
Pagination.
Definition of scalars.
When type Query is not in the file, ObjectResolverSignature appears anyway.
Implement a build command that creates a production artifact.
+ guide on how to bundle a docker package
Support for multiple files in pumpkin codegen
